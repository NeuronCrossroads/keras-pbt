# keras-pbt
A repository for the PBT module which uses Population Based Training to train neural networks. This implementation in Keras is synchronous.

# Working on:
Since Keras is graph based, I could create separate models with the same input. Maybe I could run fit on the all at once and they will each learn with their different settings. I haven't put much thought into it, but it may be possible.
